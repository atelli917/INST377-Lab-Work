<p>CSS selectors let you <em>select</em> individual HTML elements in an HTML document. This is <strong>super</strong> useful.
Classes are ridiculously important, since they allow you to select arbitrary boxes in your web pages. Once you successfully 
develop a set of selectors and CSS rules, it's relatively easy to match a document to
those rules.
